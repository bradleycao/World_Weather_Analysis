# World Weather Analysis
In this project, I created some scripts for an app called PlanMyTrip. The purpose of this app is to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences. 

To do so, I have created a Pandas DataFrame with 2000 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real-time. Then, I will have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary from the list of potential travel destinations. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API that I already linked, the software will create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
